# ShieldKnightPrototype
A WIP prototype for a 3D Shield Knight game.

Main features are to display a variety shields that can be used by the player for combat, traversal and interacting with the environment.

Each shield is themed after a potential boss character (a la "The Order of No Quarter").

Aims are to develop:

Standard Shield - Primary shield type. Can be thrown at targets (cross between Captain America's shield/Leviathan axe from God of War), used to barge across short
distances (like Wario/King Knight's Shouder Bash), slam the floor and block attacks and parry projectiles.

Projectile Shield - Shield comprised of three smaller circling shields that can be shot as projectiles either individually at a single target or consecutively at
multiple targets. Can use the rotation of the shields to slow descent from jumps (Rayman's helicopter hair) and block attacks, though each landed attack removes a 
projectile leaving the player vulnerable to damage once all are removed.

Coil Shield - A whip like shield used to pull smaller objects to the player to be thrown or grapple the player to heavier objects or fixed points in the environment.
Can be used to launch the player higher into the air with a spring jump.

Wave Shield - A surf board shaped shield that deals heavy damage at the cost of slower attacks. Player can surf on the shield across un traversable terrain and grind on
appropriate parts of the envirnment. Guard will block all attacks but only for a limited period of time where the player is locked in a stationary position.
